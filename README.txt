I tried to make website which is based on .psd website picture which I found on internet. I tried to make the same website as psd picture using HTML, CSS and Boostrap. 
The most imporatnt features are:
-one you go navbar, you can see it has underline and yellow color during cursor goes
-when cursor goes to second card in forst row, hidden content will appear.

by the way, that psd picture is saved in folder as template.psd.
